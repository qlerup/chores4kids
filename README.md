A family-friendly chores system for Home Assistant — **integration + Lovelace card bundled in one package**.

- **The integration** is the local data & sync engine: it stores children, tasks, points, and an optional reward shop as Home Assistant entities and services.
- **The card** is the UI: an **Admin view** for parents and a **Kid view** for each child.

No cloud. No telemetry. Fast, local, and built for daily use.

## What you get ✨

### UI (Lovelace Card)
- **Two modes:** `admin` (parent) 🧑‍💻 and `kid` (child) 🧒
- **Children management:** add, rename, remove, view points & pending approvals
- **Task lifecycle:** Assigned → In progress → Awaiting approval → Approved
- **Repeat & auto-assign:** plan repeating chores on specific weekdays
- **Icon picker:** search & pick Material Design Icons
- **Scoreboard:** optional ranking of children by points
- **Reward shop:** items with images, prices, and optional HA actions on purchase
- **Multi-language i18n:** includes English, Danish, and more

### Backend (Integration / Sync Engine)
- Persists **children, tasks, points, shop items and purchase history** as HA entities
- Exposes services in the `chores4kids` domain (called by the card)
- **Daily rollover at 00:00** for repeated tasks
- Maintenance helper to remove leftovers from older versions

---

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. In HACS → **Integrations** → **⋯ → Custom repositories**
2. Add this repository URL as **Integration**:
   ```
   https://github.com/qlerup/chores4kids
   ```
3. Install **Chores4Kids**
4. **Restart** Home Assistant
5. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Chores4Kids** and press **Submit**

### Lovelace Resource (Card JS)

Depending on your HACS setup, the resource may be added automatically.

If you don’t see the card in the UI editor:
1. Go to **Settings → Dashboards → Resources**
2. Add the resource that HACS installed (typically under `/hacsfiles/...`), e.g. something like:
   - `/hacsfiles/chores4kids/chores4kids-card.js`
3. Set type to **JavaScript Module**
4. Reload the dashboard

> Tip: In HACS, open the installed entry and check the “Instructions” panel — it shows the exact resource path.

## Quick start (Card configs) ⚙️

### Admin view (parents)

```yaml
type: custom:chores4kids-dev-card
mode: admin
show_scoreboard: true
```

### Kid view (for a specific child)

```yaml
type: custom:chores4kids-dev-card
mode: kid
child: "Emma"
```

> If the child list is empty in the editor, you can type the name manually.

---

## How it works 🧠

The integration creates entities that the card reads from `hass.states`, and services that the card calls to update data.

### Entities created 🧱

#### 1) One sensor per child — **Points**
- **Name:** `Chores4Kids Points {Child Name}`
- **State:** current points (integer)
- **Attributes:** `child_id`, `child_name`, `slug`, task counts, plus a minimal list of tasks for that child

#### 2) All tasks (collection)
- **Entity:** `sensor.chores4kids_tasks`
- **State:** number of tasks
- **Attributes:** `tasks` (full list)

#### 3) Shop (optional)
- **Entity:** `sensor.chores4kids_shop`
- **State:** number of active items
- **Attributes:** `items` and `purchases`

---

## Task lifecycle 🔄

1. **Assigned** 📌 → Visible and linked to a child
2. **In progress** 🔧 → Kid pressed **Start**
3. **Awaiting approval** 📨 → Kid pressed **Complete task**
4. **Approved** 🥳 → Parent approves, points are awarded

Other states you may see: **Unassigned** and **Rejected**.

---

## Repeat & Auto-assign 🔁📅

- Choose weekdays (Mon–Sun) for a task to repeat
- Optionally pick a default child (`repeat_child_id`) to auto-assign on those days
- Save the plan — the card calls `chores4kids.set_task_repeat`

If **Auto-assign** is active, manual assignment can be disabled for that task (the UI will indicate this).

---

## Reward Shop 🛒🎁

Create rewards kids can buy with points:
- Title, price, optional icon & image
- Toggle **Active** to show/hide in kid view
- Purchase history is stored in HA

### Advanced shop actions ⚙️⏱️

Rewards can trigger Home Assistant actions when purchased:
- **Service steps** (e.g. turn on a switch)
- **Delay steps** (seconds/minutes/hours)
- Run steps in order

Example: “Xbox time 30 min”
1) `switch.turn_on`
2) delay 1800s
3) `switch.turn_off`

---

## Daily rollover (00:00) 🌙

Every night at **00:00**, the integration:
1. Removes old assigned tasks from previous days (templates can remain)
2. Creates today’s tasks for any chores that match `repeat_days`
   - If `repeat_child_id` is set → assign to that child
   - Otherwise → use the task’s current assignment as the target

---

## Internationalization 🌍

The card includes multiple languages (including English and Danish) and localizes based on your Home Assistant language settings.

---

## Troubleshooting 🧰

- **Card shows no data**
  - Make sure the integration is installed, configured, and HA was restarted
- **No children listed**
  - Create children in Admin view (or call `chores4kids.add_child`)
- **No tasks**
  - Create one in Admin view (or call `chores4kids.add_task`)
- **Shop empty for kids**
  - Ensure items are **Active**
- **Shop images not showing**
  - Use `chores4kids.upload_shop_image`, then reference `/local/chores4kids/<filename>`
- **Leftover sensors/devices after upgrade**
  - Run `chores4kids.purge_orphans`

---

## Upgrading from the old split repos (card + sync) ♻️

If you previously installed **two separate HACS repos**:
1. Remove the old entries from HACS (card + sync)
2. Install this bundled repo
3. Verify your Lovelace **Resources** point at the new JS file (remove old resource entries if needed)
4. Restart Home Assistant
